# btctrader #

This project was my attempt at creating an automated Bitcoin trader. It interfaces with a couple of different Bitcoin exchange APIs in order to obtain up-to-date price/trade information, as well as make its own trades when certain conditions are met. The meat of the code lives in the btctrader/trader folder. It was designed to cache historical trade data locally, and use this to make trading decisions. Trading strategies could also be retroactively simulated, in order to test the merits of a particular strategy.

Note that I eventually lost interest in this project and it was never completed - however, it serves as a strong example of my coding style.
